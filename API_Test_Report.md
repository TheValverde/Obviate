## ❌ Failed Tests Analysis

### 1. Column Operations Issues (4 failures)

**Problem:** Multiple column operations are returning 500 Internal Server Errors

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `GET /v1/columns/board/{id}` - Column listing by board
- `POST /v1/columns/{id}/reorder` - Column reordering
- `DELETE /v1/columns/{id}` - Column deletion

**Root Cause:** Server-side implementation issues in column management logic

**Impact:** 
- 🔴 **HIGH** - Blocks column reordering functionality
- 🔴 **HIGH** - Blocks column deletion functionality
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Alternative endpoint available for column listing

### 2. Card Operations Issues (5 failures)

**Problem:** Card update, movement, reordering, and deletion operations failing

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `PUT /v1/cards/{id}` - Card updates
- `POST /v1/cards/{id}/move` - Card movement between columns
- `POST /v1/cards/{id}/reorder` - Card reordering within columns
- `DELETE /v1/cards/{id}` - Card deletion

**Root Cause:** Server-side errors in card management operations

**Impact:**
- 🔴 **HIGH** - Blocks card modification functionality
- 🔴 **HIGH** - Blocks card movement functionality
- 🔴 **HIGH** - Blocks card reordering functionality
- 🔴 **HIGH** - Blocks card deletion functionality

### 3. Server Disconnection Issue (1 failure)

**Problem:** One column reorder operation resulted in server disconnection

**Affected Endpoint:**
- `POST /v1/columns/{id}/reorder`

**Root Cause:** Possible server crash or timeout during reorder operation

**Impact:**
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Intermittent issue affecting column reordering

## 📋 Conclusion

The Kanban For Agents API demonstrates **strong core functionality** with a **80.4% success rate**. The foundation is solid with excellent workspace and board management capabilities. However, **critical issues** exist in column and card operations that need immediate attention before production deployment.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Robust workspace and board management
- ✅ Excellent system health monitoring
- ✅ Proper error handling for invalid requests
- ✅ Fast response times for most operations

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ Column reordering and deletion failing
- ❌ Card update, movement, and deletion failing
- ❌ Server stability concerns during complex operations

**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize fixing the 500 errors in column and card operations
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add monitoring and logging for production readiness
4. Conduct thorough testing after fixes are implemented

The API is **functional for basic operations** but requires **immediate attention** for advanced features before production use.
